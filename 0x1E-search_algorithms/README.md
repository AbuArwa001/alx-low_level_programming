## Tasks

1. **Linear search**
   - Prototype: `int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
   - Description: Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.
   - Requirements:
     - Must return the first index where the value is located.
     - If the value is not present in the array or if the array is NULL, the function must return -1.
     - Print the value being checked in the array every time it is compared.
   
2. **Binary search**
   - Prototype: `int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);`
   - Description: Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.
   - Requirements:
     - Must return the index where the value is located.
     - Assume that the array will be sorted in ascending order and the value wonâ€™t appear more than once.
     - If the value is not present in the array or if the array is NULL, the function must return -1.
     - Print the array being searched every time it changes.
   
3. **Big O #0**
   - Description: Determine the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.
   
4. **Big O #1**
   - Description: Determine the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.
   
5. **Big O #2**
   - Description: Determine the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.
   
6. **Big O #3**
   - Description: Determine the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.
   
7. **Big O #4**
   - Description: Determine the space complexity of the given function / algorithm.
