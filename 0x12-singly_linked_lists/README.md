# 0x12. C - Singly linked lists

#### Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

- Data Structures.
#### Data Structures
#### What is a data structure?
Data structures, as the term implies, are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use, and create data, depending on the task at hand. If data is a plate of food, data structures are your utensils (algorithms would be how to effectively use those utensils in this analogy). Just as you will likely select a spoon to eat a bowl of soup rather than a knife, you will learn over time to select and properly use data structures which fit the nature of the data you are working with. When you begin learning basic data structures such as arrays and linked lists, you will start to conceptualize how data is stored, searched, and edited, and what these operations will contribute to the space/time complexity of your program at runtime (this will make more sense once you start to learn about Big O notation). As you continue to learn more complex data structures, you may notice that you need to think more abstractly and deliberately in order to properly implement them. But with patience and practice you will begin to see patterns emerge that will allow you to intuitively see which situation calls for which data structure, just as you know to pick up a spoon when you see a bowl of soup

#### Resources
##### Read or watch:
- Linked Lists
- Google
- Youtube


- printf (3)

#### Requirements
##### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
- All your files should end with a new line
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the ```Betty``` style. It will be checked using ```betty-style.pl``` and ```betty-doc.pl```
- The only C standard library functions allowed are ```malloc``` and ```free```. Any use of functions like ```printf```, ```puts```, ```calloc```, ```realloc``` etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into acc
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarde
#### **GitHub**
There should be one project repository per group. The other members do not fork or clone the project to ensure only one of the team has the repository in their github account otherwise you risk scoring 0%

#### More Info
Please use this data structure for this project:
~~~
/**
 * struct list_s - singly linked list
 * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
 * @len: length of the string
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 */
typedef struct list_s
{
    char *str;
    unsigned int len;
    struct list_s *next;
} list_t;
