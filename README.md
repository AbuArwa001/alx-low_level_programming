## What is low-level programming? 

* In modern times, low-level programming is any language in which you (the developer) handle memory management. Any language where that memory management or garbage collection is done for you, which is now most languages, is considered “high level.” 

* Low-level programming is basically everything that is close to the hardware you are running your code on. It can have different meanings depending on your target. If you construct a building, you always start with the foundation and build on top of that. Low-level development is that foundation – if you start with high-level programming, then you don’t understand what’s going on underneath.

  	    Pro Tip: "Garbage Collection" is when the system cleans up for you. In C programming, you have to clean up after yourself. 

### Examples of low-level programming languages

* In the old days, C was considered a high-level language. Today, many engineers might laugh at that because C is now so low level. C and C++ are now considered low-level languages because they have no automatic memory management. 

* The definition of low-level has changed quite a bit since the inception of computer science. Today, we would not qualify C as a low or high-level language, but rather more like an intermediary language. The only true low-level programming is machine code or assembly (asm). Assembly is as close as possible to what the CPU (the computer's processor) can execute, as it is literally a text translation of the binary code which the CPU understands. For example, compression libraries are typically built in C, and very specific parts would be built using assembly, but the amount of assembly is getting lesser because compilers are getting so much better at optimization.
